   - "Upgrade to create more than 3 rooms"
   - "Upgrade to remove ads"
   - "Upgrade for private rooms"

2. **Trial periods:**
   - 7-day Pro trial for new users

   - Show badges for Pro users
   - "Join 10,000 Pro users"

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $9.99/month?
- Standard SaaS pricing (Spotify, Netflix, Discord Nitro)
- Low enough to be impulse purchase
- High enough to generate meaningful revenue

### Why annual discount (10 months for price of 12)?
- Increases LTV (lifetime value)
- Reduces churn
- Predictable revenue

### Why tiered pricing?
- Appeals to different user segments
- Upsell path (free → pro → studio)
- Anchoring (Pro looks cheap next to Studio)

---

## Churn Mitigation

### Expected Churn Rates
- Free users: 50-70% annually (normal for freemium)
- Pro users: 20-30% annually
- Studio users: 10-15% annually

### Tactics to Reduce Churn
1. **Engagement loops:**
   - Daily parties (habit formation)
   - Friend notifications (social retention)
   - Room history (sunk cost)

2. **Win-back campaigns:**
   - Email: "We miss you" with special offer
   - Survey: "Why did you cancel?"
   - Re-engagement: "Check out what's new"

3. **Pause instead of cancel:**
   - "Pause your subscription for 1-3 months"
   - Retains user relationship

## Conclusion

Campfire monetization should follow the **freemium + virtual goods** model proven by Discord, Spotify, and Twitch.

**Key principles:**
1. Free tier must be genuinely useful (acquire users)
2. Pro tier must feel like a upgrade, not a necessity
3. Studio tier targets power users (creators, hosts)
4. Virtual goods create ongoing engagement + revenue
5. Pricing should be simple and transparent

**Expected outcome:** $156K ARR in Year 1 → $15M+ ARR by Year 5 (assuming strong execution and growth).

Start simple, iterate based on data, and always prioritize user experience over revenue extraction. 🔥`;
